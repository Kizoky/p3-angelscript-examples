# Postal 3 AngelScript Examples
This is a repo to contain all the AngelScript examples I have created for Postal III or Catharsis Reborn

### Utils
Contains global functions to use in script files, some of them are incomplete
### Infighting
Contains a brute-forced “fix” for NPC infighting, normally this should be fixed in Postal3Script alone instead
### NPC_Template
Contains an example to invoke NPC Templates from maps, this can be useful if you want to get rid of the randomness' “pattern”
### Trespassing
Contains an example that adds Postal 2-like trespassing system (like also from Catharsis Reborn)
